# NewMedico - Hospital Management System

## Project Overview

**NewMedico** is a hospital management system designed to streamline administrative tasks and improve efficiency. It allows hospital management (admin) to add, view, update, and delete patient details, prescriptions, and reports, while patients (users) can securely access and view their respective medical data. The system includes role-based access control and integration with an NFC-based UID system for secure identification and role selection.

## Features

- **Role-based Access**: Admins can manage all aspects of the system, while patients have view-only access to their own data.
- **Patient Management**: Admins can add, update, and delete patient information.
- **Prescription Management**: Admins can manage prescriptions, while patients can view their prescribed medications.
- **Reports Management**: Admins can upload reports in image or PDF format. Patients can view their own reports.
- **Secure Login System**: Role selection and login based on a unique UID with different permissions for admin and user roles.
- **UID Verification**: A UID (obtained from an NFC card) is required to access the system, ensuring a secure and personalized experience.
- **Responsive Frontend**: User-friendly and visually appealing interface built with React, featuring a dynamic dashboard.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios for API communication
- **Arduino Integration**: Arduino-based UID reading using NFC
- **State Management**: React State and Context API for managing user session and data flow

## Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running locally or on a cloud service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- Arduino setup with NFC integration for UID reading

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ucs200525/newMedico.git
    ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd newMedico
    ```

3. **Install server dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Install client dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

5. **Set up environment variables**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following values:
      ```bash
      MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
      PORT=5000
      ```

6. **Run the project**
    - Run the backend server:
      ```bash
      npm run server
      ```
    - Run the frontend client:
      ```bash
      cd client
      npm start
      ```

7. **Access the application**
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Admin Role
1. Login as an admin using your credentials.
2. Verify your UID using the NFC card.
3. Use the dashboard to manage patients, prescriptions, and reports.

### User Role
1. Enter your UID to view your details without requiring a login.
2. Navigate through the different sections to view your prescriptions and reports.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Security**: Implementing two-factor authentication for admin login.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Sending notifications to patients about prescription updates or new reports.
- **Data Analytics**: Adding analytics to help hospital management make informed decisions.
